# YardStick One + RfCat Documentation

As I could not find any online documentations - I started to write my own. I'm new to this whole topic and try my best to be so correct as possible. Please feel free to add or correct me!

_Note:_ This documentation is more about [YardStick One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/) and [RfCat](https://github.com/atlas0fd00m/rfcat)! YardStick One comes with RfCat firmware installed and also has CC Bootloader installed, so you can upgrade RFCat or install your own firmware without any additional programming hardware.
